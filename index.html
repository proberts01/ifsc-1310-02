        <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
        <p>I think it is important to make websites accessable, not just because that's what everyone says, but because my grandparents have trouble viewing websites so they use the reader. There has been multiple cases where I have had to read out the options for them on general use websites that you would expect to be "up to code" but are very lackluster in options for impairments.
          From a <em>SIMPLE</em> Google search, <q>Web accessibility is not a new concept, but it is now more relevant than ever, with almost 2 billion people living with disabilities worldwide and relying on the web for information, education, and more.</q></p>

        <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
        <p>Here is another example close to me (Highschool Robotics). Every year you start out with the base functions like a drive train. You never over complicate with all these different bells and whistles starting out.
          This is exactly the same case for websites, I tried adding all the bells and whistles to my first project in web tech, it took me hours and then I scrapped it. Some websites also forget some of the basics because they add all the fancy stuff, which is EXACTLY something that happened Senior year of highschool with our robot.
          Here is a <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">link</a> to an article I read.
